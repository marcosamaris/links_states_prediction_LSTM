# Comparison of LSTM Techniques to Predict Link Travel Time in São Paulo City

Link travel time predictions are very useful for people who take decisions in urban transport. Bus systems are impacted by many factors, such as dynamically varying traffic, passenger demand, weather conditions and cultural and sports events.  Nowadays, researchers have done effort to implant big data and machine learning techniques to improve services in big cities such as urban mobility. Deep learning techniques arisen in the last decade and they brought a large variety of techniques to be applied in smart city problems. LSTM in a recurrent neural network which have been used to predict future state in time series. In this work, We used historical data to generate the link states and compare the train process efficiency and prediction accuracy of (5) different architectures of LSTM. We also proposed a big data model based on geographical areas which could be implanted in São Paulo City with an optimum trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Results show that LSTM-Bidirectional can be used to predict whole the links of São Paulo city obtaining the best trade-off of efficiency and accuracy.
